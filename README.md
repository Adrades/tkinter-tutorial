# Tkinter tutorial for beginners

When I was getting started with Python I loved writing Tkinter GUIs. At
first they felt really complicated because the tutorial I was following
wasn't very good. Even the hello world example had a class with
inheritance, and I didn't know what was a class at the time.

This tutorial consists of minimal examples and focuses on explaining
common mistakes. You don't need to have any experience in GUI
programming to read this tutorial, all you need is [basic Python
skills](https://github.com/Akuli/python-tutorial/tree/master/basics#basics).

Here's the list of contents:

1. [Getting started](getting-started.md)
2. [Button widgets](buttons.md)
