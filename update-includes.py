"""Simple include directives.

This script allows you to write markdown like this:

    [include]: # (some/cool/file.py)
    ```python
    ```

The [include] directive is abusing markdown's footnote syntax, so it
won't be visible when the markdown is rendered.

Then you can run this script, and the markdown will be replaced with
this:

    [include]: # (some/cool/file.py)
    ```python
    here's the content of some/cool/file.py
    ```
