# Event Loop and Threads

In the button chapter [we used time.sleep in a callback
function](buttons.md#blocking-callback-functions), and it froze
everything. This chapter is all about what happened and why. You'll also
learn to use things like `time.sleep` properly with your tkinter programs.

## Tk's Main Loop

Before we dive into other stuff we need to understand what our
`root.mainloop()` calls at the ends of our programs are doing.

When a tkinter program is running, Tk needs to do multiple different
things at the same time. It does that by breaking everything into tiny
pieces. So it does a little bit of something, then it does a little bit
of something else, then comes back to the first thing and so on. This is
called an **event loop** or **main loop**.

More fancy words: things that run bit by bit are **asynchronous**, and
other things are **synchronous**. If a synchronous function runs for
more than 0.01 seconds or so, it's also **blocking**. For example,
`time.sleep` and `print` are both synchonous, but only `time.sleep` is
blocking.

## After Callbacks

The `after` method is documented in [after(3tcl)][after(3tcl)], and it's
an easy way to run stuff in Tk's main loop. All widgets have this
method, and it doesn't matter which widget's methods you use.
`any_widget.after(milliseconds, callback)` runs `callback()` in Tk's
mainloop after waiting for the given number of milliseconds. [The
callback must not block, otherwise everything
freezes.](buttons.md#blocking-callback-functions)

For example, this program displays a simple clock with after callbacks and
[time.asctime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.asctime):

[include]: # (timeout-clock.py)
```python
import tkinter as tk
import time


# this must not block
def change_text():
    label['text'] = time.asctime()

    # now we need to run this again after one second, there's no better
    # way to do this than timeout here
    root.after(1000, change_text)


root = tk.Tk()
label = tk.Label(root, text='0')
label.pack()

change_text()      # don't forget to actually start it :)

root.geometry('200x200')
root.mainloop()
```

## Threads

So far we have avoided blocking in every possible way, but now we'll run
something that blocks. We can do this with [the threading
module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html). Here's a
minimal example:

[include]: # (printy-threads.py)
```python
import threading
import time
import tkinter as tk


# in a real program, we would have some other blocking thing than
# time.sleep and we would use after callbacks if we really want to sleep
def blocking_function():
    print("blocking function starts")
    time.sleep(1)
    print("blocking function ends")


def start_new_thread():
    thread = threading.Thread(target=blocking_function)
    thread.start()


root = tk.Tk()
button = tk.Button(root, text="Start the blocking function",
                   command=start_new_thread)
button.pack()
root.mainloop()
```

That's pretty cool. It's a blocking function, but it doesn't freeze our
GUI like [this example](buttons.md#blocking-callback-functions) did.

As usual, great power comes with great responsibility. Tkinter isn't
thread-safe, so **we must not do any tkinter stuff in threads**. Don't
do anything like `label['text'] = 'hi'` or even `print(label['text'])`.
It may kind of work for you, but it will make different kinds of weird
problems on some operating systems.

Think about it like this: usually we can do stuff with tkinter but not
with blocking functions, but in threads we can do stuff with blocking
functions but not with tkinter. So we can block or use tkinter, but not
both in the same place.

### Moving stuff from threads to tkinter

The blocking thread world and the asynchronous tkinter world must be
separated from each other, but we can move stuff between them with
[queues](https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html). They work like
this:

```python
>>> import queue
>>> the_queue = queue.Queue()
>>> the_queue.put("hello")
>>> the_queue.put("lol")
>>> the_queue.get()
'hello'
>>> the_queue.get()
'lol'
>>> the_queue.get()      # this blocks forever, press Ctrl+C to interrupt
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
KeyboardInterrupt
>>> the_queue.put('wololo')
>>> the_queue.get(block=False)
'wololo'
>>> the_queue.get(block=False)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
queue.Empty
>>>
```

There are a few things worth noting:

- If you make a variable called `queue`, then you can't use the `queue`
  module. That's why I named it `the_queue` instead.
- Things came out of the queue in the same order that we put them in. We
  put `"hello"` to the queue first, so we also got `"hello"` out of it
  first. If someone talks about a FIFO queue or a First-In-First-Out
  queue, it means this.
- We are not using a list or
  [collections.deque](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque)
  for this. Queues work better with threads.
- If the queue is empty, `some_queue.get()` blocks until we put
  something on the queue or we interrupt it. If we pass `block=False` it
  raises a `queue.Empty` exception instead, and never blocks.

Usually I need queues for getting stuff from threads back to tkinter.
The thread puts something on the queue, and then an [after
callback](#after-callbacks) gets it from the queue with `block=False`.
Like this:

[include]: # (thread2tk.py)
```python
import queue
import threading
import time
import tkinter as tk

the_queue = queue.Queue()


def thread_target():
    for number in range(10):
        print("thread_target puts hello", number, "to the queue")
        the_queue.put("hello {}".format(number))
        time.sleep(1)

    # let's tell after_callback that this completed
    print('thread_target puts None to the queue')
    the_queue.put(None)


def after_callback():
    try:
        message = the_queue.get(block=False)
    except queue.Empty:
        # let's try again later
        root.after(100, after_callback)
        return

    print('after_callback got', message)
    if message is not None:
        # we're not done yet, let's do something with the message and
        # come back ater
        label['text'] = message
        root.after(100, after_callback)


root = tk.Tk()
label = tk.Label(root)
label.pack()

threading.Thread(target=thread_target).start()
root.after(100, after_callback)

root.geometry('200x200')
root.mainloop()
```

Checking if there's something on the queue every 0.1 seconds may seem a
bit weird, but unfortunately there's not a better way to do it. If
checking the queue every 0.1 seconds is too slow for your program, you
can use something like 50 milliseconds instead of 100.

Of course, you can use any other value you want instead of None. For
example, you could add `STOP = object()` to the top of the program, and
then do things like `if message is not STOP`.

### Moving stuff from tkinter to threads

We can also use queues to get things from tkinter to blocking threads.
Here we put stuff to the queue in tkinter and get in a thread, so we
don't need `block=False`. Here's an example:

[include]: # (tk2thread-broken.py)
```python
import queue
import threading
import time
import tkinter as tk

the_queue = queue.Queue()


def thread_target():
    while True:
        message = the_queue.get()
        print("thread_target: doing something with", message, "...")
        time.sleep(1)
        print("thread_target: ready for another message")


def on_click():
    the_queue.put("hello")


root = tk.Tk()
tk.Button(root, text="Click me", command=on_click).pack()
threading.Thread(target=thread_target).start()
root.mainloop()
```

Run the program. You'll notice that it kind of works, but the program
just keeps running when we close the root window. You can interrupt it
with Ctrl+C.

The problem is that Python is waiting for our thread to return, but it's
running a `while True`. To fix that, we need to modify our
`thread_target` to stop when we put None on the queue, and then put a
None to the queue when `root.mainloop` has completed. Like this:

[include]: # (tk2thread.py)
```python
import queue
import threading
import time
import tkinter as tk

the_queue = queue.Queue()


def thread_target():
    while True:
        message = the_queue.get()
        if message is None:
            print("thread_target: got None, exiting...")
            return

        print("thread_target: doing something with", message, "...")
        time.sleep(1)
        print("thread_target: ready for another message")


def on_click():
    the_queue.put("hello")


root = tk.Tk()
tk.Button(root, text="Click me", command=on_click).pack()
threading.Thread(target=thread_target).start()
root.mainloop()

# we get here when the user has closed the window, let's stop the thread
the_queue.put(None)
```
